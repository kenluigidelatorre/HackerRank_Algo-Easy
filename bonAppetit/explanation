This program helps figure out if Anna was charged the right amount for a shared meal. 
It adds up the bill without the item Anna didn’t eat, splits the cost fairly, and then 
checks if what she paid matches her share. If it does, it says “Bon Appetit”; if not, 
it shows how much she was overcharged. The program reads the bill details, runs the check, 
and prints the result.
