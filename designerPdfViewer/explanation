The designerPdfViewer function calculates the highlighted area for a word in a PDF viewer where each letter has a 
different height. It looks at each letter in the word, finds its height from the given list, and keeps track of 
the tallest letter. Then, it multiplies the tallest height by the length of the word to get the total area highlighted. 
This way, it finds how much space the word will take when highlighted.
