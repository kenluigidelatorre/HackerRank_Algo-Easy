This program simulates a game where you jump around a circular array of clouds. Starting with 100 energy points, you jump in 
steps of size k. Each jump costs 1 energy, and if you land on a thundercloud (marked by 1), you lose an extra 2 energy. The 
program calculates how much energy you have left when you return to the starting point.
