This program figures out how many days between i and j are “beautiful.” 
A day is called beautiful if, when you reverse its digits and find the 
difference from the original day, that difference can be divided evenly 
by k. For example, if the day is 120, its reverse is 21, and the difference 
is 99. If 99 divides evenly by k, then that day is counted as beautiful.
