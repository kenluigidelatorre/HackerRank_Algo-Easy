This program counts how many perfect squares exist between two numbers, a and b, inclusive. It calculates the smallest square 
root greater than or equal to a and the largest square root less than or equal to b, then finds the difference between these 
to get the count of squares in that range. If there are none, it returns zero. The main program reads multiple pairs of numbers 
and outputs the count of perfect squares for each pair.
