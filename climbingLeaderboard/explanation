This program solves the **Climbing the Leaderboard** problem. It first creates a unique, 
sorted list of scores from the leaderboard, then checks each of the player’s scores to 
find their rank. Starting from the bottom, it compares the player’s score against the 
leaderboard scores and determines where the player fits in. Finally, it returns a list 
of the player’s ranks after each game. The program reads the input, runs the ranking 
logic, and prints the results.
