This program figures out how many times the letter 'a' shows up if you repeat a given string s over and over until you reach n 
characters. Instead of repeating the string and counting every time, it smartly counts how many 'a's are in the original string, 
then calculates how many full repeats fit into n, and finally counts the 'a's in the leftover part. This way, it works really fast 
even if n is huge.
