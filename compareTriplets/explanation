This program solves the **Compare the Triplets** problem. It compares two lists of three scores eachâ€”one 
for Alice and one for Bob. For each score position, it awards a point to whoever has the higher score. 
At the end, it returns the total points Alice and Bob earned. The program reads the scores, compares 
them, and prints the final scores side by side.
