This program counts how many groups of three numbers in the array form a 
sequence with the same step d. A triplet is called beautiful if the second 
number is the first plus d, and the third number is the second plus d. 
For example, if d = 2 and the array has [1, 3, 5, 7], then (1, 3, 5) and 
(3, 5, 7) are beautiful triplets.
