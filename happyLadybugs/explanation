This program checks if ladybugs in a string can be arranged so that all identical ones are together, making them "happy." If there are 
no empty spaces, it checks if they’re already grouped. If there are empty spaces, it ensures no ladybug appears just once (since singles 
can’t be grouped). It returns "YES" if a happy arrangement is possible, otherwise "NO."
