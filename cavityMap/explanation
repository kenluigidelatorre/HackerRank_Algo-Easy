This program solves the **Cavity Map** problem. It looks at a grid of numbers and 
marks any cell that is bigger than all of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) 
with an 'X'. The cells on the edges are never marked because they don’t have neighbors 
on all sides. The program reads the grid, checks each inner cell, replaces the “cavities” 
explwith 'X', and then prints the updated grid.
