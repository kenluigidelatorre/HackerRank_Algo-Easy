This program adds up a list of really big numbers. It reads how many numbers there are, 
then reads the numbers themselves, and adds them all together using the aVeryBigSum 
function. The main part of the program takes care of getting the input ready by removing 
extra spaces and splitting the numbers properly. In the end, it prints out the total sum. 
Itâ€™s useful when you need to handle numbers too big for regular integer types.
