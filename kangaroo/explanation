This program checks if two kangaroos starting at different positions and jumping at different speeds 
will land at the same spot after the same number of jumps. It returns "YES" if they can meet and "NO" 
if they canâ€™t. The logic accounts for equal speeds and ensures the meeting point occurs at a non-negative 
number of jumps.
