This program helps find the most expensive combination of one keyboard and one USB drive that can be bought without going over a given budget. 
It checks every possible pair of keyboard and drive prices, adds them up, and keeps track of the highest total thatâ€™s still within budget. If 
no combination fits the budget, it returns -1. Finally, it prints out the amount that would be spent in the best-case scenario.
