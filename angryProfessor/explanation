This program decides if a class gets canceled depending on when students arrive. 
Each student has an arrival time: 0 or less means they are on time, and a positive 
number means they are late. The teacher needs at least k students to be on time for 
the class to happen. The program counts the students who are on time. If that number 
is at least k, the class goes on and it prints "NO". If not enough students are on 
time, the class is canceled and it prints "YES".
