This program counts how many valleys a hiker walks through during a hike. A valley starts when the hiker goes 
below sea level and ends when they come back up to sea level. The hike is represented by steps up ('U') and down ('D'). 
The code keeps track of the hikerâ€™s altitude and counts a valley each time they step up to sea level from below. Finally, 
it returns the total number of valleys crossed.
