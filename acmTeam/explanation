This program finds out which team of two people knows the most topics. Each person has a string of 1s and 0s, 
where 1 means they know a topic and 0 means they donâ€™t. The program checks every pair of people, adds up the 
topics they know together, and keeps track of the highest number found. It also counts how many teams reach 
that highest number. In the end, it shows the maximum topics a team can know and how many teams got that result.
