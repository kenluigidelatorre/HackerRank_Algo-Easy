This program counts how many pairs of socks can be made from a pile of socks represented by numbers. It takes the 
total number of socks and a list of sock types as input. Then, it counts how many socks there are of each type. 
For each type, it calculates how many pairs can be formed by dividing the count by two (ignoring any leftover 
single socks). Finally, it adds up all the pairs from every type and returns the total number of pairs.
