This program solves the **Cat and Mouse** problem. It figures out which cat will 
reach the mouse first based on their starting positions on a number line. The 
function calculates the distance each cat is from the mouse and returns "Cat A" 
or "Cat B" depending on whoâ€™s closer. If both cats are the same distance away, it 
returns "Mouse C" to show the mouse escapes. The program reads multiple test cases, 
runs this check for each, and prints the results.
