This program figures out how many apples and oranges land on a house. The house is between two points on a line, 
and the "Apples and Oranges"fall from their trees some distance away. By adding those distances to the tree positions, 
the program finds where each fruit lands. Then it counts how many fall inside the house area and prints those numbers.
