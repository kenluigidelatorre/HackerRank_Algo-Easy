This program helps determine how many magic potion doses a runner needs to jump over the tallest hurdle. 
Given the runnerâ€™s current jump height and a list of hurdle heights, it finds the tallest hurdle and 
calculates how many extra units the runner must boost their jump to clear it. If the runner can already 
jump over all hurdles, it returns zero.
