This function counts how many pairs of numbers in a list add up to a number thatâ€™s divisible by a given number k. 
It looks at every possible pair in the list, adds them together, and checks if the sum can be divided evenly by k. 
If yes, it adds to the count. At the end, it tells you how many such pairs there are in total.
