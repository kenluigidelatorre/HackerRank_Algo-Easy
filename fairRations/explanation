This function tries to make every number in the list even by giving out loaves of bread in pairs. It goes through the list 
and whenever it finds an odd number, it gives one loaf to that person and one loaf to the next person, so both become even. 
It keeps track of how many loaves are given out this way. If, at the end, the last number is even, it returns the total loaves 
given. If it’s impossible to make all numbers even, it returns “NO.”
