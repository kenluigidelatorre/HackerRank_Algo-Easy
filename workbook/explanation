This program simulates a workbook where problems are split across pages. Each chapter has a certain number of problems,
and each page can hold up to k problems. A special problem is one where the problem number matches the page number it's on.
The program loops through each chapter and tracks the current page number. It counts how many special problems occur as the 
chapters are filled into the workbook.
