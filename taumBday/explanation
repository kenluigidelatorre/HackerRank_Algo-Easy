This program helps Taum calculate the minimum cost to buy b black gifts and w white gifts. Each color 
has its own cost (bc for black, wc for white), but Taum can also convert one color to the other at an 
extra cost z. For each gift, the program decides whether to buy it directly or convert the other color. 
It then adds up the total cost based on the cheaper option for each. This ensures Taum always gets the 
best deal.
