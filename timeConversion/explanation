This program converts time from 12-hour AM/PM format to 24-hour (military) time. It reads the hour and checks 
if it’s AM or PM. If it’s AM and the hour is 12, it changes the hour to 00. If it’s PM and the hour is less 
than 12, it adds 12 to convert it. The rest of the time (minutes and seconds) stays the same, and the result 
is printed in 24-hour format.
