This program sorts a list of very large numbers that are too big for normal 
integer types. Since the numbers are given as strings, it first compares 
them by length: shorter numbers come first because they are smaller. If 
two numbers have the same length, it compares them digits by digits like 
normal strings. This way, even extremely large numbers can be sorted correctly.
