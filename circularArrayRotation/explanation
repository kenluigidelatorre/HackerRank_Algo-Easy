This program solves the **Circular Array Rotation** problem. It rotates an 
array to the right by `k` positions and then answers queries about the 
values at specific positions after the rotation. Instead of rotating 
the entire array, it calculates the original index of each queried 
position before the rotation and returns the corresponding value. 
The program reads the input, runs the rotation logic efficiently, 
and prints the results for each query.
