It looks at the list of numbers and counts how many times each number appears. Then it finds the number that shows up the most. 
To make all the numbers in the list the same, you’d need to change all the other numbers into that most common number. The function 
tells you how many changes you’d have to make to do that — basically, the total number of elements minus how many times the most 
frequent number appears.
