This program solves the **Chocolate Feast** problem. It calculates how many chocolates 
you can eat if you start with some money (`n`), each chocolate costs `c`, and you can 
exchange a certain number of wrappers (`m`) for a free chocolate. The function first 
buys as many chocolates as possible, then keeps trading wrappers for free chocolates 
until it canâ€™t trade anymore. The program reads multiple test cases, runs the calculation 
for each, and prints the total chocolates eaten.
