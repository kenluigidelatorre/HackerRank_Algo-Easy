This program adjusts student grades based on specific rounding rules. If a grade is less than 38, it's left as is because 
it's already failing. For higher grades, if the next multiple of 5 is within 2 marks, the grade is rounded up to that number. 
Otherwise, it stays the same. The program applies this rule to a list of grades and prints the final results.
