This code simulates repeatedly cutting sticks until none remain. Each time, it cuts all sticks by the length 
of the shortest stick, then removes the sticks that are fully cut (length zero). It records how many sticks 
are left before each cut and returns this list of counts. The process continues until no sticks are left.
