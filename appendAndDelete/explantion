This program checks if you can turn one string into another in exactly k steps, 
where each step is either deleting the last character or adding a new one. It 
first finds the common beginning of both strings, then counts how many deletions 
and additions are needed. If the total steps match k, the answer is "Yes". If the 
steps are fewer, it checks if the extra moves can still be used (like doing extra 
delete-and-append or rebuilding the string). Otherwise, the answer is "No".
