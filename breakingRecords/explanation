This program solves the Breaking the Records problem. It keeps track of how many 
times a player breaks their highest and lowest score records during a season. It 
looks at each gameâ€™s score, updates the records when a new high or low is reached, 
and counts how many times that happens. At the end, it shows how many times the 
player broke their best and worst scores. The program reads the scores, runs this 
check, and prints the results.
