This C# program solves the **Birthday Cake Candles** problem. It finds the 
tallest candle height from a list and counts how many candles have that height. 
The `birthdayCakeCandles` function uses this logic to return the count. The `Main` 
method handles reading the input (number of candles and their heights), calls the 
function, and outputs the number of tallest candles that can be blown out.
